The Community Cancer Fund provides much needed funds to give financial assistance for our patients in need, alongside to providing funds for patient education and support programmes. It also ensures our patients, patients like Mr Goh Chang Teck, receive the best possible treatment and have the best possible outcomes. 

In 2007, Chang Teck was diagnosed with skin cancer at the tender age of 13. It never occurred to Chang Teck or his family that cancer could strike at such a young age.  In 2013, when he was about to enlist in the army, his cancer returned.  He was unable to pursue his dream of joining the army and serving his country like all his friends could. He felt lost, guilty and a sense of burden to his family.

Thanks to NCCS and the support of his family, Chang Teck has now recovered and finds strength and hope in running, clocking about 15km each time.  He is determined to beat cancer and inspire others not to give up in the face of adversity. Chang Tek hopes to raise awareness for cancer and share his story in order to make a difference in the lives of others.

This Lunar New Year, join Chang Teck in his quest to fight cancer by making a gift today. Your generosity will enable the Community Cancer Fund to help NCCS deliver cancer awareness education to the community, provide welfare support to needy patients and develop cancer care initiatives to benefit those affected by the illness.

But can you imagine if each step you took caused your body excruciating pain? If the thought of leaving the house filled your eyes with tears as you prepare to brace yourself against the slightest movement that could aggravate your chronic pain symptoms? That is the reality for many chronic pain patients everyday. 

WHO estimates about 22% worldwide are affected by chronic pain. In many cultures, expressions of pain may be perceived as form of weakness; that the individual is not strong enough to overcome or cope with the pain. This often leads to low self-esteem and self-worth. 

What often compounds the problem is that the pain that is experienced by the patients is often invisible. How do people empathize when they cannot see the pain externally? ""I am in pain"" should not be a stigma and define who we are. This campaign wants to educate and promote awareness of chronic pain within Asian cultures. 

We want to improve medicine for pain management through research.

Little is known on how play supports children with a disability in terms of the development of executive and 21st century skills.

The Centre remains open to all other children at the same time to promote the spirit and importance of inclusiveness. For children with varying disabilities and their families, admission is supported by donations and the doors are open free for them.

Through different activities, they have been able to express their creative potential, develop crucial skills such as communication and collaboration, and form new meaningful relationships. 

Giving Tuesdays has now become a weekly activity that they look forward to where they enjoy dedicated playtime with their family members and new friends, for the two hours or more that they are here for. We are also witnessing how parents of these families are gradually forming a community, as they interact and share relatable experiences.

Through our deep-impact programmes and outreach that enhance social-emotional learning and confidence building, we work closely with children under our community partners such as Family Service Centres (FSCs), Children's Home & Child Protection Services, and as well as children with special needs to ensure that all children have the space and time to play creatively.

Elderly suffering from this brain disease lose their personalities and memories, long before they pass away. For their loved ones, it is a protracted period of loss.

In Singapore, 1 in 10 above the age of 60 suffer from dementia. By the age of 80, this rises to 1 in 3. 

Dementia, which has no cure, requires Singapore to try new and bold approaches.

One of these is using therapy animals.

In this new programme, elderly with dementia strengthen their emotional and mental well-being through activities with therapy animals, which are themselves rescued, unwanted, injured. 

In medical lingo, this is known as the provision of psycho-social care. 

In simpler terms, it is about giving the elderly the opportunity to love and care again, a role that these elderly have played their entire lives. 

When elderly are engaged like that, many other benefits fall into place naturally - they start speaking, joking, standing, walking, working their arm muscles. Their eyes sparkle again.

Although similar programmes exist overseas and validated by research (Stanford University, University of Pittsburgh, etc), the idea is new to Singapore. 

Thus, we are hoping to find supporters who want to accompany us on this journey into an unknown, yet important, area.

She was only 10 years old when I was diagnosed with glaucoma. By the time Mandy turned 12, I was completely blind. During that same year, my world came crashing down as I was also struck down with kidney failure. All I see now is darkness with an image of Mandy frozen at that age. 
You know, it can be very stressful and suffocating having to care for my child and also worrying about my dialysis fees. I am really thankful for the financial help that NKF has given me to sustain my life on dialysis for the past 12 years. I am just so thankful for every single day that I am given. I can spend time with the people I love. This is very important to me as it keeps me going. I look forward to the day when I can hold Mandy's child in my arms and enjoy my time as a grandmother.

During that same year, my world came crashing down as I was also struck down with kidney failure. All I see now is darkness with an image of Mandy frozen at that age. 
You know, it can be very stressful and suffocating having to care for my child and also worrying about my dialysis fees. I am really thankful for the financial help that NKF has given me to sustain my life on dialysis for the past 12 years. I am just so thankful for every single day that I am given. I can spend time with the people I love. This is very important to me as it keeps me going. I look forward to the day when I can hold Mandy's child in my arms and enjoy my time as a grandmother. 

As kidney failure is on the rise, more and more kidney patients like me need your help as it is very tough for us to walk this journey on our own.

Your support means a lot to us!

Your support through this meaningful campaign will give many more patients like Mdm Koh Siew Hoon a chance to lead fulfilling lives and face the future with hope. Please donate now!","The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is currently supporting more than 5,000 kidney failure patients, about two-thirds of the national kidney failure patient population. Our patients are of the lower income group. Treating a patient costs over $2,000 a month, however, the treatment our patients receive is highly subsidised, with 74% paying $50 or less a month out-of-pocket. 

NKF remains committed to journeying with our patients every step of the way in their treatment and rehabilitative care, advocating kidney health to prevent kidney failure and making a difference in the renal landscape to benefit the community. 

Partner us in giving Life & Hope to our patients now!

All donations received through Giving.sg will be channelled to NKF General Fund, which will be used to provide subsidised dialysis treatment and holistic care for our patients.

Little is known on how play supports children with a disability in terms of the development of executive and 21st century skills. Understanding what children can do through play is a process of discovery and Giving Tuesdays provides the opportunity for further exploration and observation on this.

Through different activities, they have been able to express their creative potential, develop crucial skills such as communication and collaboration, and form new meaningful relationships. We are also witnessing how parents of these families are gradually forming a community, as they interact and share relatable experiences.

Peter Lim Cancer Survivor
In 2012, my relative recommended Kampung Senang to me after I had undergone radiation and chemotherapy for nose and throat cancer. I have been coming here since to do therapies such as the torsion field, hydro-bath, and qigong. I feel blessed to have work with the wonderful people at Kampung Senang.

Jenny Ng, Cancer survival
Twenty years ago, I was diagnosed with lymphoma and underwent chemotherapy. Upon the advice of a trusted friend, I switched over completely to a plant-based diet. When Kampung Senang came into existence, I started coming to its educational talks, workshops, and seminars, and to borrow its collection of books on dealing with cancer holistically. The knowledge and experiences I gained gave me the reassurance and confidence that changing my diet was the right thing to do. My lifestyle today incorporates natural therapies and TCM. In the past year, I discovered Member's Day at Kampung Senang and have been coming to this event regularly. It gives me a reason to exercise, do qigong, yoga, therapy and sharing sessions.","Kampung Senang started with a simple idea 21 years ago: to support those affected by cancer with an array of services to support their journey of healing. 

These services include:

The Gift of Good Food Scheme where volunteers make home visits to 2,517 cancer survivors bearing organic fruits and vegetables (which costs up to $20,000 a year). We also distribute Gifts of Wellness (healthy food as festive gifts) to 200 needy families of cancer survivors.

Holistic Support for People Affected by Cancer where our 1,600 members find support in one another, attend healthy lifestyle courses, and access various non-invasive and natural therapies.  

Mobility Aids Service & Training Centre, run by 3 staff and a team of volunteers, repairs and refurbishes used mobility equipment such as wheelchairs, commode chairs and hospital beds and loans these equipment to over thousands of families who do not qualify for government subsidies and yet are financially stretched.

The challenge: 
A self-navigated race across 1000km of wild Mongolia landscape and 28 semi-wild horses. Only half the riders are able to finish the race!

She has secured one of just 45 spaces on this wild ride. 

The Mongol Derby will be held from 2 to 14 August 2020. 

Note: The welfare of the horse is of utmost priority during this race.  A highly experienced team of international and Mongolian equine veterinarians provide the inspections at every horse station and response capabilities on the course. They ensure that horse welfare is maintained throughout the race and have the power to impose harsh penalties on riders who fail the vet inspections. To the nomadic Mongolians living on the steppe, these horses are an integral part of their social culture and cared for deeply.

For animals, life is lockdown. 

At EQUAL, we work with rescued animals to strengthen the mental health of people with special needs, youth, families and elderly.

In other words, we rescue animals who go on to rescue us. 

Every year, we serve 1,500 beneficiaries. Our therapy horses and cats may not look pretty outside, but they are beautiful inside.

Through an Animal-Assisted Learning curriculum, our team of professionals help beneficiaries develop social-emotional skills such as self-compassion, managing impulsivity, discipline and confidence, to help them succeed in school and life.

Such skills are difficult to teach. That's where EQUAL comes in. 

Animals help people connect with their inner world, creating deep and long-lasting change.

Currently, our programmes are suspended. 

But after Covid-19, our work will help Singapore recover, by soothing the invisible and deep damage Covid-19 is making on the inner lives of vulnerable Singaporeans.

*Note: Thanks to your support, we reached our previous goal of $1,000!

To accommodate more supporters, we are increasing the target to $5,000. We hope you can help us reach that too.","""The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.""

Her husband, an ex-offender currently staying at a halfway house, also lost his job as a mover during this period.

Please help ensure that patients are not forgotten in times of crisis. Dedicated teams and volunteers in BMDP are overcoming the ever-changing obstacles such as new hospital guidelines; logistic barriers and lockdowns by countries; safety precautions when meeting marrow donors, etc. -- All towards the mission of ensuring marrow donors are safe and patients receive the healthy life-saving gift of stem cells/ bone marrow in critical time.

The COVID-19 outbreak started off as a public health issue and has evolved into a global crisis, which caused disruption to the world order. Preventive measures though essential, have taken their toll on the economy. Many countries are slipping into recession, with social unrest surfacing as more people become unemployed. Vulnerability profiles increase with more assistance schemes required, ranging from daily necessities to mental support. We urge more people to come together to help the vulnerable groups tide through this trying period.

Since mid-February, Tzu Chi Foundation (Singapore) launched a series of epidemic relief initiatives to care for people like our long-term care recipients, migrant workers returning from China, frontline workers, stranded Malaysian migrant workers and students who require digital devices for their Home-Based Learning. To-date, more than 1000 people and households have benefitted from our initiatives. For more details, please visit our website at https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/featured/updates-on-covid-19/.

Launched in 2005, The Business Times Budding Artists Fund (BT BAF) originated from a conviction that no child with strong interest and potential in the arts should be denied the opportunity to develop his or her talents due to a lack of financial resources.

The Fund reaches out to financially disadvantaged children and youth from six to 19 years old where they receive fully sponsored arts training at The Little Arts Academy and 10 Square Youth. The training provides opportunities for the beneficiaries to explore and nurture their interest and talents in music, dance, theatre, visual arts and technology. Over the years, the children and youth have grown in confidence and resilience through their journey in the arts. We are  heartened by the research conducted by Kantar Consulting in 2019 that showed a strong impact of the arts training on our beneficiaries' socio-emotional development and aspirations (baf.sg/impact-of-bt-baf/).

We hope you may open your hearts to support our children and youth so that they may continue to pursue their artistic talents and achieve their aspirations.  All donations qualify for 2.5 times tax deduction.

Run by the Law Society's charity arm, Law Society Pro Bono Services, CLAS would go on to be the spark that set off a pro bono movement in Singapore. As one of Singapore's foremost litigators, the founding partner of Harry Elias Partnership had represented all and sundry. But the poor had a special place in his heart. He took on CLAS' first case, securing the dismissal of charges against a woman accused of stealing milk for her baby.
35 years on, CLAS is going strong and is one of the Law Society's proudest crowning achievements. In 2015, the CLAS Fellowship was birthed to train passionate young lawyers to defend vulnerable accused persons. Each year, thousands have benefitted from CLAS, with the CLAS Fellowship taking on one third of these cases.
While we may mourn the passing of Mr Elias SC, we will celebrate his life, and now live his legacy.  Your support will be instrumental in ensuring that young lawyers with a heart for securing justice for the needy will have a chance to follow in the footsteps of legal legends. Your donation will go towards all expenses arising from the CLAS Fellowship.

Lisa* is a single mother of 2 who works part-time. She relies heavily on the child maintenance provided by her husband to raise her children. With no explanation, her husband moved out earlier this year and has since stopped providing financial support. Two weeks ago, he filed for divorce. With the circuit breaker measures in place, Lisa struggled to find legal and financial aid. Aside from the emotional toll of the situation, she still had to look after her children, assisting them with home-based learning. MSC advised her on her rights as a wife and mother. She filed for child maintenance with the Courts and if successful, her husband would have to provide monthly financial support for their two children. We registered her for our legal clinic where our volunteer lawyers can advise on navigating the divorce process. With the help of MSC, Lisa is now more emotionally supported and able to make informed decisions on her situation.

While most of the country went under lockdown during the circuit breaker, the demand for some of our services rendered by our Service Fund actually increased. One example would be our Maintenance Support Central (MSC), which provides support and assistance for clients who have difficulty receiving spousal and child maintenance, or who require legal assistance. Support us in assisting women like Lisa who need our help.","SCWO is now an IPC!

COVID-19
Currently, WHO nods to evidence of airborne transmission in crowded indoor spaces. More research is needed to investigate if airborne transmission is a big driver of COVID-19. NCID is studying if the coronavirus is naturally airborne, and infectious in such a form.

Other COVID-19 studies to keep the pandemic under control include:
a. Studying the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection
b. Assessment of available Rapid Diagnostic test kits for use at GP clinics, Polyclinics and emergency rooms

Antibiotic resistance
Matthew was 39 years old when what started as a sore throat turned into a life-threatening, drug resistant infection. To save his life, doctors had to amputate his arms and legs. Matthew beat the odds and survived.

Antibiotic resistance is a serious global health threat as bacteria become superbugs - resistant to antibiotics and therefore can multiply and become stronger. Without effective antibiotics, medical procedures such as surgery, and organ transplant would be risky. Antibiotic-resistant infections affect people from all walks of life. The infections often start with something benign such as a seemingly harmless sore throat or ear infection.","National Healthcare Group Fund (NHGF), UEN: 201623926M, is a registered charity with Institutions of Public Character (IPC) status.

World Braille Day,  is observed to raise awareness of the importance of Braille as a means of communication in the full realization of the human rights for blind and partially sighted people. Braille is a tactile representation of alphabetic and numerical symbols using six dots to represent each letter and number, and even musical, mathematical and scientific symbols. Braille (named after its inventor in 19th century France, Louis Braille) is used by blind and partially sighted people to read the same books and periodicals as those printed in a visual font.

Our main services include Braille Lessons, Transcription of print materials into Braille, Production of Tactile Diagrams and Braille Signages, Emboss Braille on print name cards, Braille Audit Service and others.

She can sleep better throughout the night without the machine disrupting her sleep and can shower more conveniently as she no longer has to cover up the catheter and redress the area. She can go out with her family and friends without any restrictions and has even travelled to Malaysia and Thailand!

These came from the realities of the children of reformed offenders. When an individual goes to prison, he or she is not the only one affected. Their family members suffer greatly in many ways too, especially the children. Studies have shown that due to the various factors and negative exposures, there is a higher likelihood for them to follow their parent's missteps and commit crimes, a phenomenon known as intergenerational offending.

Through the Fairy Godparent Programme, we reach out to these children from low-income families via various academic and pro-social initiatives (see image 3 for list) throughout their growing up years. When COVID-19 hits, we had to step up and go virtual to continue engaging these children because we know that this is the time the families require support the most, with the pandemic aggravating their already challenging situation.

Mrs C faced this challenge 2 years ago when her husband and breadwinner suffered a brain stroke and became bedridden. Unable to sit upright due to his brain injuries, Mr C was restricted to his bed.  Like many other bedbound elderly, Mr C could only receive wipe-down cleaning, sponge or powder baths from his caregiver. 

This is where the GoodLife! HomeBathing team comes into the picture. Established in October 2018, the team helps to bathe bedbound elderly like Mr C on a monthly basis.

2. Family Justice Support Scheme: Pro bono legal representation for family law issues for foreign spouses with Singaporean children; and
3. Ad Hoc Pro Bono Scheme: Pro bono legal representation for those in urgent and exceptional need, who do not qualify for any existing legal aid schemes.

In EQUAL, we serve 1,500 beneficiaries every year, comprising youths, people with special needs, families, and the elderly with dementia and depression.

Through an Animal-assisted learning curriculum, EQUAL help people facing challenges open up to create changes in mindsets and behaviours that are deep and long-lasting; learning social-emotional skill sets that are important but conventionally hard to teach. This work is new to Singapore but Animal-assisted Learning and Therapy is well-established in Europe, North America, South America and Oceania with decades of proven outcomes.

Little is known on how play supports children with a disability in terms of the development of executive and 21st century skills. Understanding what children can do through play is a process of discovery and Giving Tuesdays provides the opportunity for further exploration and observation on this. 

Over the last one year, we have had over 10 families who came regularly for the programme, where they engage in different forms of artful play - painting, role-playing, tinkering and more. Through different activities, they have been able to express their creative potential, develop crucial skills such as communication and collaboration, and form new meaningful relationships. We are also witnessing how parents of these families are gradually forming a community, as they interact and share relatable experiences. 

With the first programme piloting at the Children's Centre for Creativity, it is now making its way directly into schools (and other spaces) to support children with disabilities. 

We are seeking for more donations to support more children to be part of Giving Tuesdays.","Playeum is an independent charity organisation (IPC) that champions children through play, creativity and the arts. We advocate for children's voices and the development of crucial 21st century skills such as problem-solving, communication, collaboration, critical thinking and more, through the play and the arts. 

Through our deep-impact programmes and outreach that enhance social-emotional learning and confidence building, we work closely with children under our community partners such as Family Service Centres (FSCs), Children's Home & Child Protection Services, and as well as children with special needs to ensure that all children have the space and time to play creatively.

Though the Boys went through online CCA in the pandemic year, this did not stop them from looking forward to the activities planned out for them in 2021. With each of your generosity, the Boys will be well supported in the different programmes to uncover their potential.

We also believe that the Boys will learn to be responsible citizens by serving their community. They will be given opportunities to serve the community, such as BB Share-a-gift (where they get the chance to bring their parents along and deliver bags of items to the families) and BB Cares (where they get to serve at the elderly homes).

With Bethel Presbyterian Church as the sponsoring church, the Company started with just 15 Boys and Mr. David Wong as the teacher-in-charge.

Despite our relatively short history, we grew stronger and began to find our forte through an eclectic mix of adventure, discipline and character-building. With that, the Company has been awarded the J M Fraser Bronze Award in 2003. Since 2008, we are proud to say that we have been obtaining the J M Fraser Gold Award.

Today, the Company has over 50 Boys, 5 Officers, 3 Primers and 2 volunteers. The teachers-in-charge from Zhonghua Secondary are also invaluable partners who play significant roles in contributing to the growth of the Boys. The Company strives to do its utmost through the delivery and imparting of life-changing and interesting character-molding lessons and mentoring to the Boys. We will also continue to give back to the community through our BB CARES outreach to the elderlies in the nursing home and the BB Share-a-Gift project with the collection of food rations and distribution to the needy.

81J, Townsville Primary School(TVPS) was established in 2001 and is an integral part of student life in TVPS. In The Boys' Brigade, the Boys learn different skills and character values that allow them to grow as young boys.

For this year's BB Week, a simple act of generosity from you can help our Boys look forward to exciting programmes that can continue to help them discover more about their talents and skills!

Though the Boys went through online CCA in the pandemic year, this did not stop them from looking forward to the activities planned out for them in 2021. With each of your generosity, the Boys will be well supported in the different programmes to uncover their potential.

We also believe that the Boys will learn to be responsible citizens by serving their community. They will be given opportunities to serve the community, such as BB Share-a-gift (where they get the chance to bring their parents along and deliver bags of items to the families) and BB Cares (where they get to serve at the elderly homes).

""In The Boys' Brigade 14th Singapore Company, based in Anglican High School, we aim to develop all Boys who pass through our ranks into fine young Men who are leaders of sound character and godly values. We do this by exposing our Boys to a wide array of adventure activities such as hiking expeditions, archery and high elements aimed at developing character, leadership and team-building skills. As the Boys promote through our ranks, they are accorded appointments which give them the invaluable opportunity to plan and execute various programmes as well as to lead their peers and younger Boys. The annual BB CARES project is one example in which our Boys are given the opportunity to lead in planning and execution. Beyond leadership abilities, community service projects like BB CARES and BB Share-a-Gift also allow our Boys to give back to the community.

We aim to develop our Boys to be mentally, socially and physically strong youths.

Our vision is aligned with the BB Object, which is the advancement of Christ's kingdom among Boys and the promotion of habits of Obedience, Reverence, Discipline, Self-respect and all that tends towards a true Christian manliness. Our theme for 2021 is to Walk in Love amongst the Boys & Officers, adapted from 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. 

As serving the community is one of BB's key beliefs, we aim to develop Boys who have the heart and willingness to serve others through projects such as BB Share-A-Gift, BB Cares, outreach to kindergartens and letting them be involved directly in the planning and execution of meaningful activities to demonstrate their compassion and commitment.


During weekly parades, apart from letting the Boys learn about desirable moral values through the sharing of Biblical verses and stories, they are also exposed to drill and adventurous activities that aim to strengthen their personal mastery in these areas. They can also participate in Brigade level competitions such as the annual BB Blaze and BB Character Quest. 

With the addition of a new bagpipe band, our Boys can choose to be part of the band and be trained by experienced instructors and thereafter be given performance opportunities.","The Boys' Brigade (BB) was founded in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1883 as a uniformed youth organisation.

Launched in 2005, The Business Times Budding Artists Fund (BT BAF) originated from a conviction that no child with strong interest and potential in the arts should be denied the opportunity to develop his or her talents due to a lack of financial resources.

The Fund reaches out to financially disadvantaged children and youth from six to 19 years old where they receive fully sponsored arts training at The Little Arts Academy and 10 Square Youth. The training provides opportunities for the beneficiaries to explore and nurture their interest and talents in music, dance, theatre, visual arts and technology. Over the years, the children and youth have grown in confidence and resilience through their journey in the arts. We are  heartened by the research conducted by Kantar Consulting in 2019 that showed a strong impact of the arts training on our beneficiaries' socio-emotional development and aspirations (baf.sg/impact-of-bt-baf/).

We hope you may open your hearts to support our children and youth so that they may continue to pursue their artistic talents and achieve their aspirations.  All donations qualify for 2.5 times tax deduction.

With these intervention programmes tailored to children from at-risk backgrounds, Playeum looks to break the cycles that hold them back by striving for long term impact and inspiring children to take charge of their own circumstances and be able to meet their fullest potential. Through open-ended play, children become masters of their own worlds, where creating, exploring, conquering fears, negotiating, making decisions and resolving conflicts become second nature.

The programme includes learning to code, applying coding on Sphero robots, and using morse code and spin art kids to explore connections. One of the participants, Aniq said, ""I get bored in school because all the teachers try to make us become more interested in the topic by talking, but if the teaching method could be more like this, we will be keen to learn"".

Did you know dementia is not a part of normal aging?

Dementia is a neurodegenerative condition that causes progressive cognitive decline, leading to increasing difficulties in coping with everyday activities. The condition affects the brain, causing brain cells to die at a faster rate than normal. As a result, the cognitive capabilities of the person with dementia declines. 

While the signs, symptoms & behaviours of dementia may vary from person to person, some common characteristics are failing memory, deterioration of intellectual function, & personality changes. Whilst there is no cure for dementia yet, engaging persons living with dementia with activities & customised therapies to interests, also known as using the Person-Centred Care approach can help keep their minds stimulated, & may help to slow down & delay the progression of the condition.

Our beneficiary's testimony (Social Support)
Mdm L suffers from depression, anxiety disorder and insomia. Her husband was in the halfway house and she was all alone at home with no family support. Mdm L lost her part-time job and had not been successful in sourcing for another job. Her savings was depleting and she felt extremely insecure and lost. She was worried about her daily living expenses and the Covid-19 situation further aggravated her condition. FaithActs provided her with groceries and household items to tide her through. Subsequently, her husband was granted an early release and she was relieved as she could now have support with her husband. They seek out to work as general cleaners and FaithActs continue to encourage and counsel her.","FaithActs is a non-profit community care service agency serving the needs of children, youths, families, and seniors in Singapore since 2004.

Each year, we care for 2,000 inpatients and 3,000 outpatients, regardless of race, language or religion. Over the years, our multi-disciplinary healthcare team has looked after close to 50,000 inpatients and outpatients.

To celebrate this significant milestone, we are launching a campaign themed ""Celebrating Silver"", which carries a key message to raise awareness on staying healthy and ageing well in one's silver years.

The campaign will culminate in a virtual fundraising event on 15 October 2021, 8.30pm where we will launch a short film and a virtual book that encapsulate ""25 stories above 65"" - celebrating 25 inspiring individuals aged 65 above, ageing well and making a positive impact in the community. Minister for Health, Mr Ong Ye Kung is our Guest-of-Honour for the event.

We are a team with a diverse crew of animal-assisted intervention professionals who are former MOE teachers, social workers, counsellors, animal trainers and jockeys. 

In EQUAL, we serve beneficiaries comprising youths, people with special needs, families, and the elderly.

Through an Animal-assisted learning curriculum, EQUAL help people facing challenges open up to create changes in mindsets and behaviours that are deep and long-lasting; learning social-emotional skill sets that are important but conventionally hard to teach. This work is new to Singapore but Animal-assisted Learning and Therapy is well-established in Europe, North America, South America and Oceania with decades of proven outcomes.

To do our work, EQUAL relies heavily on support from the public, as government funding typically covers only a percentage of the costs of charities.

The median amount to acquire a pair of hearing aids is approximately $3,000 and could easily go up to $15,000 if better features are required for work/education purposes as they enable clients to achieve better sensory input.

I have severe dry eyes and endured sleepless nights from the burning sensation and pain in my eyes. The blurry images also affected my driving and I could not drive family around anymore. All these changed after I was introduced to plasma eyedrops. The pain is gone and I now can drive again. Most importantly, I started to sleep soundly every night. It has given me a new lease of life! 

Mr Ang (name changed to protect privacy) and many patients suffering from severe dry eyes were given a new lease of life, thanks to this new research innovation arising from the Ocular Surface Research Group in SERI.

Plasma from cord blood can be developed into eyedrops to treat severe dry eyes. This had improved the quality of our patients' lives. Further research will enable us to make personalized medicine, as further customization of useful anti-inflammatory proteins and growth factors in the eyedrops can be performed according to each patient's tear abnormality.  This example highlights the importance of translational research by SNEC and SERI. But research like this needs continuous philanthropic support to be able to develop future therapeutics for blinding eye diseases.","Launched in July 2016, VisionSave is a novel initiative that taps on philanthropic investment to usher in innovative eye care research, treatment and delivery in Singapore and the region.

At our unit, we carry out clinical trials that look to increase the accuracy of breast imaging scans, to better predict treatment response and to improve post-surgery care. We participate in multicenter collaborations with other local and regional hospitals and partner research institutes both locally and internationally. Through this work, we have explored new drugs to treat drug-resistant cancers, developed liquid biopsy assays to detect and monitor breast cancer and have profiled tumours and blood to gain a deeper insight into the processes that govern tumour behaviour.

When all other treatment has failed, a bone marrow transplant is their only chance of survival.

When patients are unable to find a matching donor within their family, they come to us in search of a Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD), who could give them a second chance at life. As finding a MUD means a healthy donor with the same DNA profile, the odds of finding that unique match is very low.

Thus since 1993, we at the Bone Marrow Donor Programme (BMDP) are committed to building and managing Singapore's only register of volunteer marrow donors. Providing hope for patients suffering from blood-related diseases.

So excited to share about The Eye Run/Cycle 2021 - the first virtual fundraiser by SNEC and SERI! This newest challenge is for the vital purpose of saving sight, and lending a helping hand to eye research and education for blindness prevention! I've signed up for this event to play a small part in this important cause, and it's kicking off soon, from 1 October to 30 November. 

I'm Ho Ching Lin, and I am motivated to take on this challenge - I'm a Senior Consultant ophthalmologist, as well as a clinician researcher and educator. I specialise in glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and one of the top eye diseases linked to ageing. In Singapore alone, glaucoma is behind 40% of blindness cases!

I treat both adults and children with this disease, so I am committed to beating this 'silent thief of sight'! Also, as Director of Philanthropy and Development for the Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences Academic Clinical Programme (Eye ACP), I'm pumped and ready to lead by example in supporting VisionSave, the beneficiary of this challenge.

While I usually spend more time on the mat as a yogi, I've pledged to cover 50km on foot in The Eye Run/Cycle to create awareness for glaucoma and other blinding diseases. I hope to raise $25,000 towards research and education that will preserve the eyesight of many people. Help me reach my donation goal and join the fight against blindness today!","Launched in July 2016, VisionSave is a novel initiative that taps on philanthropic investment to usher in innovative eye care research, treatment and delivery in Singapore and the region. It also aims to save sight and ensure optimal outcome for every patient. 

VisionSave aligns with SNEC and SERI's reputation as a centre of eye care and research excellence in Singapore, as well as the philanthropic spirit of the late SNEC founder Professor Arthur Lim, who modelled a giving spirit in both his personal and professional endeavours.

Elpis@Hideout is a Social Enterprise named after the Greek word for HOPE. Its objective is to bring hope to individuals who are marginalised and struggling, mentally or physically, to enable them to lead meaningful lives. 

Today, 1 in 10 individuals who are aged 60 years old and above in Singapore has dementia. According to the Ministry of Health, neurological diseases such as dementia are the fifth leading cause of disability in Singapore. With increased life expectancy and a rapidly ageing population, we expect the number of persons living with dementia to increase. It is therefore important to raise awareness on dementia and mental wellbeing to increase support for persons living with dementia and their caregivers. 

'A Dollar A Day' is created to raise funds sustainably for Dementia Singapore, to enable them to continue the necessary care they are providing to persons living with dementia and their families.  We want to also raise awareness on dementia which will allow for early detection. Armed with the necessary information, people living with dementia and their caregivers will be able to get the support they need much earlier.

A portion of the collections, not exceeding 30%, goes to Elpis@ Hideout for every dollar raised as part of this collaboration.","Dementia Singapore was formed in 1990 as the 'Alzheimer's Disease Association' to better serve Singapore's growing dementia community, increase awareness about dementia, and reduce the stigma surrounding the condition.
 

As Singapore's leading Social Service Agency (SSA) in specialised dementia care, Dementia Singapore aims to advocate for the needs of people living with dementia and their families; empower the community through capability-building, knowledge and consultancy; and deliver quality, person-centred care innovations.

Students with this condition suffer from visual stress which can cause discomfort and difficulty with reading, copying, and writing. They are not able to see prints clearly because they see distortions such as blurring and shaking words which makes reading painful for them. They also experience physical symptoms like headaches, dizziness, eye strain, fatigue, nausea, and migraine. Visual processing and learning are intimately related. Hence, with Visual Processing Disorder (Irlen Syndrome), one's ability to learn will be compromised due to the difficulty of processing of visual information.
Irlen Syndrome can be treated with the use of Irlen lenses which filter out the wavelengths of light that stress the brain. This alleviates the symptoms of Visual Processing Disorder, enabling the individuals to process visual information more accurately and comfortably. The cost of a pair of Irlen lenses is $500.
With your generous donation, we wish to issue these Irlen lenses to help underprivileged students at Spectra Secondary School who are currently under Financial Assistance Scheme to treat their Visual Processing Disorder (Irlen Syndrome).","FRCS is the umbrella body that unites the 23 Rotary Clubs in Singapore and is the charity arm of Rotary in Singapore.

A few of our former 12I Boys/Primers/Officers are intending to do a special fundraising project for the new Boys' Brigade Headquarters located in 10 Kwong Avenue. BBHQ is moving to a new campus after several decades at Zion Road.

As we've been impacted by the BB ministry, we have decided to adopt a room/hall in the new BBHQ, for which an appreciation plaque will be placed outside the room. It will be dedicated to our former 12I BB Captain and Officer Mr Jonathan Ng Joo Foon, for his ministry in nurturing generations of men and women through the BB, and presenting this special 'gift' to him next year in 2022, his retirement year, potentially with a physical event once the restrictions from the pandemic have been eased.

We have decided to target a fund-raising target of $20,000 in the first instance, and hope to raise it by the end of 2021 (31 Dec 2021).

We hope to attract donations of $250/$500/$1,000 per former BB Boy/Primer. Of course we will welcome any amount nonetheless.

If possible, Please let Gareth or Oliver know once you have donated by Facebook messenger so we can also invite you for the naming event when conditions permit hopefully in 2022.

We are delighted with Jega's progress and his enthusiasm to learn.  His progress was very encouraging, and we are impressed with what he has been able to achieve in this short period of intervention which has revealed his true potential in learning. However, his 30 hours of literacy intervention for the documentary series only highlighted the necessity for continued support after the completion of these 20 sessions.  Jega's continued learning journey is critical for his desire to become an independent person and not allow his dyslexia to stand in the way of his life aspirations.

It is unfortunate that Jega received his basic education at a time when dyslexia was little known and effective forms of intervention for the condition was not provided for in mainstream school. Nonetheless, it is","In our efforts to continuously provide and improve our professional services to dyslexics in Singapore, we rely heavily on public donations to sustain our daily operations. DAS provides more than $1 million in bursaries every year and this figure is rising. Without support from the generous people and organisations of Singapore, this support would not be possible. Please donate to DAS.

Donations received will go directly to the bursary fund for low-income families to access our services.",,,Children & Youth,,,Education,,,,,,,,,,,,,Disability,Education,,,,,,,,

The Eye Run/Cycle 2021 is the first virtual fundraiser by SNEC and SERI to raise funds for VisionSave. 

I am a retired Opthalmologist from SNEC and an avid runner.I am setting myself a challenge of running a full marathon to raise $500 for VisionSave. This will go towards helping discover new ways to detect, diagnose and develop future treatments for eye diseases. It will also help train healthcare professionals to meet the ever-evolving needs of the patients.

Boosted by my running slogan 'Never Give up', I look forward to your support to motivate me to complete my challenge.

Join me in supporting VisionSave. The donation that you contribute today, will lead to a better eye treatment tomorrow- A second Sight, A second Life.","Launched in July 2016, VisionSave is a novel initiative that taps on philanthropic investment to usher in innovative eye care research, treatment and delivery in Singapore and the region. It also aims to save sight and ensure optimal outcome for every patient. 

VisionSave aligns with SNEC and SERI's reputation as a centre of eye care and research excellence in Singapore, as well as the philanthropic spirit of the late SNEC founder Professor Arthur Lim, who modelled a giving spirit in both his personal and professional endeavours.
